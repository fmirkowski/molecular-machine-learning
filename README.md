Repository for some basic molecular machine learning projects, experimentation and work from workshop. 


Alzheimer_inhibitor.ipynb - Classifying inhibitors of Beta-Secretase 1 - a protein enzyme playing a significant role in development of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. This is binary graph classification: molecule inhibits protein production or not. I adapted a simple kNN approach.

Peptide_functions.ipynb - Predicting the functions of peptides based on molecular fingerprints. It uses peptide sequences and multiple types of molecular fingerprints, with a Random Forest model to classify the functional properties, the objective score (AUPRC) is still better than random, but relatively low compared to sota scores, will be improving this soon.
